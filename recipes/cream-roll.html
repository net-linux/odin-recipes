        <p>Old & sweet cream roll. The desert <strike>I am not particularly sure if this can be called a desert or even what to call this but who cares till it tastes good</strike> that was introduced to me my lovely grand father. In short for this story we were at park and after my play time he got me one from the local tea stall cause guess what the cities were <strong>TOO BIG</strong> to keep a stock of this small item or whatever the reason was for it I don't remember. Now they can be found at every bakery so that's good. Well anyways. This dish is the best to get a sweet mouth and if it has chocolate at the tip of it then it is the best.</p>
        
        <p>So now getting to the recipe and other things</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients for this are:-</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>puff pastry sheet as required</li>
            <li>2 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
            <li>8 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Now for the actual procedure </p>
        
        <h4>Steps:-</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Cut puff pastry sheet into strips. To start with, take a puff pastry sheet and cut it into a long ribbon-like piece. Cut as many pieces you want. Make sure that all the pieces are neither too wide nor too thin in width.</li>
            <li>Shape and bake the pastry rolls. Now, take wood dowels and roll a piece of puff pastry sheet around it. Roll other pieces around the dowels as well. Now, cook them in the oven at 180 degree Celsius for about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the cooked pastry rolls cool. When done, remove from oven and let it cool. When cooled slightly, take the wood out of the cooked pastry rolls.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cream filling. Meanwhile, take a bowl and add vanilla essence, powdered sugar, milk and butter. Mix it and add milk slowly-slowly to the mixture while mixing it.</li>
            <li>Fill the pastry roll with prepared cream. When done, transfer the mixture in a piping bag and roll the piping bag. Cut the tip of the piping bag. Take puff pastry roll and pipe in the mixture inside the opening/centre of the roll.</li>
            <li>Now for the best part. Use some chocolate sauce to put at the tip of the cream roll while also covering a bit of it from the sides to give a heavenly feel of the great <strong>CHOCOLATE SAMA</strong></li>

        </ol>
