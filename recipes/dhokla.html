        <p>This is the only desert that I love the most when it is home made only. I never liked the way it was made at the various sweets shops. The one made by my mother was the best among the home made ones that I have eaten in the past 10 years. While I haven't been able to recreate my mother's recipe for this I have rather somehow able to learn to make this from the internet itself so here I'll be showing how to make it the same way. <strike>I'll update the page when I am able to recreate my mother's recipe for this </strike></p>

        <p>Now for the actual recipe </p>

        <p>First let's talk about the ingredients</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Gram Flour (Besan/Chickpea Flour)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Semolina (rava/sooji), optional</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons Lemon juice</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons chopped Coriander Leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Fresh Coconut</li>

        </ul>

        <p>I know that this list is like a <strong>BEHEMOTH</strong> but just stay with me. Now for the steps:-</p>

        <h4>Steps:-</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Take all ingredients to prepare batter. Pour approx. 2-3 cups water in steamer at bottom and heat it over medium flame. Make sure that steamer is at least 4-5 minutes heated before placing the plates (filled with batter) in it. Grease 2 small plates or thalis (4-5 inch diameter) using 1-teaspoon oil.</li>
            <li>Take 1 cup gram flour, 1 tablespoon semolina(sooji/rava), 1½ teaspoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoons green chilli-ginger paste, 1/4 cup curd, 3/4 cup water and salt in a bowl. Mix them properly into smooth batter. Make sure that there are no lumps.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon fruit salt in batter and stir in one direction for approx. 1 minute. You will notice its size would increase to almost double.</li>
            <li>Now, pour batter immediately into each greased plate and fill it upto 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Place plates in steamer and steam for 10-12 minutes over medium flame.</li>
            <li>After 10-12 minutes, insert a knife or toothpick into dhokla and check if it comes out clean. If it does, then it is ready otherwise cook 2-3 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Takeout plates from steamer and let them cool for few minutes. Cut fluffy khaman dhokla into small squares using knife.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Now for <strong>Tempering</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small pan or tempering pan. Add1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds and a pinch of asafoetida (hing). When seeds begin to crackle, add 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, 10-15 curry leaves and 4 green chillies. Sauté them for few seconds.</li>
            <li>Add 1/3 cup water and 1 tablespoon sugar and bring it to a boil; let it cook for a minute over high flame. Tempering(tadka) is ready, pour it over dhoklas and toss gently until each dhokla is coated well with tempering.</li>
            <li>Garnish with 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves and 2 tablespoons grated coconut. Serve with green coriander chutney.</li>
        </ol>
